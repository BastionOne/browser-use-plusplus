Here’s a ladder of UI patterns you can use as test fixtures for your crawler, from trivial → evil. All are common-ish web patterns and each has a clear nested “UI hierarchy” and implied backend calls.

---

### 1. Simple navbar dropdown

**Structure**

* Top navbar with a “Products” menu item.
* Clicking “Products” opens a dropdown with 3 options:

  * “All Products”
  * “New Arrivals”
  * “On Sale”

**Interaction hierarchy**

* `Navbar > Products (click) > Dropdown options (click)`

**Backend behavior**

* Opening the dropdown does nothing on the network.
* Clicking each option triggers distinct calls:

  * `GET /api/products?filter=all`
  * `GET /api/products?filter=new`
  * `GET /api/products?filter=sale`

**What this tests**

* Basic click → dropdown → click.
* Agent must enumerate each option in a simple, flat menu.

---

### 2. Sidebar with collapsible section + nested items

**Structure**

* Left sidebar with headings:

  * “Analytics”
  * “Billing”
* “Analytics” is collapsible; closed by default.
* Expanding “Analytics” reveals:

  * “Overview”
  * “Funnels”
  * “Cohorts”

**Interaction hierarchy**

* `Sidebar > Analytics (expand) > [Overview | Funnels | Cohorts] (click)`

**Backend behavior**

* Expanding “Analytics” triggers `GET /api/nav/analytics` (to fetch available reports).
* Selecting each child triggers:

  * `GET /api/analytics/overview`
  * `GET /api/analytics/funnels`
  * `GET /api/analytics/cohorts`

**What this tests**

* Discovery of children hidden under an initially collapsed parent.
* Need to click “Analytics” before the child buttons exist.

---

### 3. Dropdown → option → modal

**Structure**

* Top navbar “Account” button.
* Clicking “Account” opens a dropdown:

  * “Profile”
  * “Security Settings”
* Clicking “Security Settings” opens a modal dialog.

Modal contents:

* Tabs: “Password”, “2FA”
* Within “Password” tab: “Change password” form.
* Within “2FA” tab: “Enable 2FA” toggle.

**Interaction hierarchy**

* `Navbar > Account (click) > Security Settings (click) > Modal`

  * `Modal > Tabs [Password | 2FA]`

    * `Password tab > Submit`
    * `2FA tab > Toggle`

**Backend behavior**

* Opening modal: `GET /api/account/security`
* Submitting password form: `POST /api/account/change-password`
* Enabling 2FA: `POST /api/account/2fa/enable`

**What this tests**

* Multi-step nested UI: dropdown → menu option → modal → internal tabs.
* Agent must interact with content inside an overlay, not only the main page.

---

### 4. Accordion inside a modal

**Structure**

* Page has a “Manage Integrations” button.
* Clicking opens a full-screen modal.
* Modal body is an accordion:

  * “Slack”
  * “GitHub”
  * “Jira”
* Each accordion item expands to reveal:

  * A “Connect” button (if not connected).
  * A “Settings” link (if connected).

**Interaction hierarchy**

* `Page > Manage Integrations (click) > Modal`

  * `Modal > Accordion item (expand)`

    * `Connect button / Settings link (click)`

**Backend behavior**

* Opening modal: `GET /api/integrations`
* Expanding each accordion:

  * `GET /api/integrations/slack`
  * `GET /api/integrations/github`
  * `GET /api/integrations/jira`
* Clicking “Connect Slack”:

  * `POST /api/integrations/slack/connect`

**What this tests**

* Hierarchy: button → modal → accordion → button.
* Agent needs to expand multiple accordions, not just the first one.

---

### 5. Data table with row expanders and “Details” drawers

**Structure**

* Central page with a data table of orders.
* Each row has:

  * “Expand” caret that reveals inline details.
  * “Details” icon that opens a side drawer (sliding panel).

**Interaction hierarchy**

* `Table > Row > Expand caret (click) > Inline details`
* `Table > Row > Details icon (click) > Right-side drawer`

**Backend behavior**

* Table initially loaded: `GET /api/orders?summary=true`
* Expanding a row:

  * `GET /api/orders/:id/details`
* Opening drawer:

  * `GET /api/orders/:id/timeline`
  * `GET /api/orders/:id/audit-log`

**What this tests**

* Multiple “secondary” actions per row.
* In-row expansion vs side drawer – both are nested under the same row.

---

### 6. Tabbed container with nested filters and infinite scroll

**Structure**

* A “Reports” page with tabs:

  * “Daily”
  * “Weekly”
  * “Monthly”
* Within each tab:

  * A filter bar with dropdowns (“Region”, “Status”).
  * A scrollable list of report cards that loads more as you scroll.

**Interaction hierarchy**

* `Reports page`

  * `Tabs [Daily | Weekly | Monthly] (click)`

    * `Filter dropdowns (click) > Filter option (select)`
    * `Scrollable list (scroll near bottom)`

**Backend behavior**

* Switching tabs:

  * `GET /api/reports?type=daily`
  * `GET /api/reports?type=weekly`
  * `GET /api/reports?type=monthly`
* Changing filters:

  * `GET /api/reports?type=daily&region=eu&status=open` (etc)
* Infinite scroll:

  * `GET /api/reports?type=daily&cursor=<token>`

**What this tests**

* DFS across tabs + nested filters.
* Agents that only click once per tab will miss filter-triggered APIs and pagination APIs.
* Need to scroll to trigger additional calls.

### 7. Nested menus with hover-triggered submenu

**Structure**

* Left vertical menu.
* “Settings” item reveals a fly-out submenu on hover:

  * “Users”
  * “Teams”
  * “Permissions”
* “Permissions” has its own nested submenu:

  * “Roles”
  * “Policies”

**Interaction hierarchy**

* `Sidebar > Settings (hover) > [Users | Teams | Permissions]`

  * `Permissions (hover) > [Roles | Policies]`

**Backend behavior**

* Hover over “Settings”: `GET /api/settings/menu`
* Hover over “Permissions”: `GET /api/settings/permissions/menu`
* Clicking final leaf items:

  * `GET /api/settings/permissions/roles`
  * `GET /api/settings/permissions/policies`

**What this tests**

* Non-click triggers (hover).
* Multi-level fly-out menus that only exist while hovered.
* Easy for agents to miss if they only click, or move mouse too quickly.

---

### 8. Context menu on right-click + nested actions

**Structure**

* A file manager grid (documents).
* Right-clicking a file opens a context menu:

  * “Open”
  * “Rename”
  * “Share”
  * “More…”
* “More…” opens a submenu:

  * “Download as ZIP”
  * “View version history”

**Interaction hierarchy**

* `File tile (right-click) > Context menu`

  * `[Open | Rename | Share | More…]`

    * `More… (hover/click) > [Download as ZIP | Version history]`

**Backend behavior**

* Opening context menu:

  * `GET /api/files/:id/context-actions`
* Clicking:

  * “Open”: `GET /api/files/:id`
  * “Rename”: (no call until submit) `POST /api/files/:id/rename`
  * “Share”: `GET /api/files/:id/share-settings`
  * “Download as ZIP”: `POST /api/files/:id/archive`
  * “Version history”: `GET /api/files/:id/versions`

**What this tests**

* Non-standard event (contextmenu / right-click).
* Nested menu within context menu.
* Some actions only trigger network on submit vs on open.

### 9. Multi-step wizard inside modal, with conditional steps

**Structure**

* “Create Project” button opens a modal wizard with steps:

  1. “Basic Info”
  2. “Members”
  3. “Advanced Settings” (only appears if user checks “Show advanced options” in step 1)

**Interaction hierarchy**

* `Page > Create Project (click) > Wizard modal`

  * Step 1: Basic Info

    * Checkbox “Show advanced options”
    * Next
  * Step 2: Members

    * Add member(s)
    * Next
  * Step 3: Advanced Settings (conditional)

    * Toggles/sliders
    * Finish

**Backend behavior**

* Opening wizard:

  * `GET /api/projects/new-schema`
* Step transitions:

  * Leaving Step 1: `POST /api/projects/draft` (save basic info)
  * Leaving Step 2: `POST /api/projects/draft/members`
* Advanced step only triggers if enabled:

  * `GET /api/projects/advanced-options`
  * Final submit: `POST /api/projects/submit`

**What this tests**

* Conditional UI: not all paths exist unless some control is toggled.
* Nested steps inside a modal, with intermediate autosaves.

---

### 10. Nested tabbed modals launched from table rows

**Structure**

* “Incidents” table.
* Each row has an “Inspect” button that opens a modal.
* Modal has two levels of tabs:

  * Top-level tabs: “Summary”, “Timeline”, “Artifacts”
  * Inside “Artifacts” there are secondary tabs:

    * “Logs”
    * “Screenshots”
    * “Attachments”

**Interaction hierarchy**

* `Incidents table > Row > Inspect (click) > Modal`

  * Top tabs: `[Summary | Timeline | Artifacts]`

    * `Artifacts (click) > Secondary tabs [Logs | Screenshots | Attachments]`

**Backend behavior**

* Opening modal:

  * `GET /api/incidents/:id`
* Timeline tab:

  * `GET /api/incidents/:id/timeline`
* Artifacts tab:

  * `GET /api/incidents/:id/artifacts`
* Secondary tabs:

  * Logs: `GET /api/incidents/:id/logs`
  * Screenshots: `GET /api/incidents/:id/screenshots`
  * Attachments: `GET /api/incidents/:id/attachments`

**What this tests**

* Deep hierarchical navigation within a single overlay.
* Multiple levels of tabbing; agent needs to explore combinations, not only top-level.

### 11. Off-canvas drawer with embedded accordions and actions

**Structure**

* Page with a list of “Customers”.
* Clicking a customer name opens a right-side drawer.
* Drawer content:

  * Header with “Edit” button.
  * Accordion sections:

    * “Profile”
    * “Billing”
    * “Usage”
  * Inside “Billing” accordion:

    * “Add payment method” button opens a nested modal.

**Interaction hierarchy**

* `Customers list > Customer (click) > Drawer`

  * `Drawer > Accordion sections`

    * `Billing accordion > Add payment method (click) > Modal`

**Backend behavior**

* Opening drawer:

  * `GET /api/customers/:id`
* Expanding each accordion:

  * Profile: `GET /api/customers/:id/profile`
  * Billing: `GET /api/customers/:id/billing`
  * Usage: `GET /api/customers/:id/usage`
* Payment modal actions:

  * `POST /api/customers/:id/payment-methods`

**What this tests**

* Drawer + nested modal overlay inside it.
* Agent must treat drawer as a navigable area, not just “view-only”.

### 12. Hidden admin section unlocked by toggle

**Structure**

* Settings page with:

  * “General”
  * “Notifications”
  * A toggle “Show advanced (admin) settings”.
* When the toggle is ON, a new sidebar section becomes visible:

  * “Admin”

    * “Feature Flags”
    * “System Logs”

**Interaction hierarchy**

* `Settings page`

  * `Toggle “Show advanced” ON`

    * `Sidebar > Admin (click)`

      * `[Feature Flags | System Logs]`

**Backend behavior**

* Initial page:

  * `GET /api/settings`
* Toggling advanced:

  * `GET /api/settings/admin/menu`
* Admin pages:

  * `GET /api/admin/feature-flags`
  * `GET /api/admin/system-logs`

**What this tests**

* Conditional navigation elements that only exist after an action.
* DFS must include flipping toggles to reveal new branches.

### How to use this

You can:

* Turn each scenario into a small, self-contained page in your test app.
* Or mix several into a single complex SPA and see how many API endpoints the agent discovers vs total defined.

If you want, next step I can turn these into a more formal “fixture spec” (e.g., JSON describing nodes, actions, and expected endpoints) or even into React/HTML skeletons that your Playwright harness can mount.
